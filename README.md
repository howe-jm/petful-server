# Welcome to Petful!

Hello!

Petful is a webapp to simulate the adoption process for pets using a first-in, first-out system that showcases the functions of linked lists and queues!

### Petful is a pet adoption webapp using the following technologies:

Client: Node.js, coupled with React for responsive web design.

Server: Node.js with Express.js.

Petful allows a user to enter a queue and wait in line to adopt a pet. While waiting, the user can watch other peoples' names move through the queue, with each one adopting a pet as they reach the top. When it's their turn, the user can choose between the next available cat or dog in their respective queues.

Read on for more information, as well as instructions for deploying this app.


## Useful Links

Petful was designed function as a client dependent on an API server, and as such, requires both ends to be completely functional. Here are the links to the repositories, and a live version of the app:
